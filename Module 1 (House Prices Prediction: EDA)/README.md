# House Prices Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project aims to explore the factors influencing house prices using a dataset from Ames, Iowa. With 79 explanatory variables, this dataset offers a comprehensive look at various aspects of residential homes. This first assignment focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships of the data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about homes in Ames, Iowa, ranging from basement height to proximity to railroads. Understanding these factors is key to predicting home sale prices.

## Objective
In this first phase, the goal is to perform **exploratory data analysis** to:
- Understand the distribution and quality of each feature
- Visualize relationships between key variables
- Identify missing values and outliers
- Assess potential features for predictive modeling in future stages

## Practice Skills
- Creative feature exploration and visualization
- Understanding relationships between variables before applying advanced modeling techniques

## Next Steps
The next steps after this phase will involve:
- Feature engineering
- Model development using advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
