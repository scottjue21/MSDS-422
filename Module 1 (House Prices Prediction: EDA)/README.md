# House Prices Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project aims to explore the factors influencing house prices using a dataset from Ames, Iowa. With 79 explanatory variables, this dataset offers a comprehensive look at various aspects of residential homes. This first assignment focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships of the data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about homes in Ames, Iowa, ranging from basement height to proximity to railroads. Understanding these factors is key to predicting home sale prices.

## Objective
In this first phase, the goal is to perform **exploratory data analysis** to:
- Understand the distribution and quality of each feature
- Visualize relationships between key variables
- Identify missing values and outliers
- Assess potential features for predictive modeling in future stages

## Techniques Used
- Feature engineering and creation of new variables
- Data visualization to assess variable distributions and relationships
- Correlation analysis to identify key predictive features

## Conclusion
The exploratory data analysis provided insights into key factors affecting housing prices in Ames, Iowa. We handled missing data and outliers, identified three strong predictors—OverallQual, GrLivingArea, and GarageCars—and created two new features (total_sq and qual_space) to improve prediction accuracy. This cleaned and transformed dataset will serve as a solid foundation for building predictive models aimed at understanding the drivers of housing prices in the Ames market.
