# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is part of a Kaggle competition to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. While most home buyers might think of bedrooms or picket fences when describing their dream home, this dataset shows that much more influences the final price. With 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes, the challenge is to predict the final sales price.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information on houses sold in Ames, Iowa, with 79 explanatory variables that describe various features of each home. The goal is to predict the sales price of each house based on these features.

## Skills Practiced

- **Creative Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance.
- **Advanced Regression Techniques**: Implementing methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for better accuracy.

## Goal

The objective is to predict the sales price for each house. For each `Id` in the test set, you must predict the `SalePrice`.

## Evaluation Metric

The project is evaluated using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted sale price and the logarithm of the observed sale price.
